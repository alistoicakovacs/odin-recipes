<h3>Short Description:</h3>
<p>This Hungarian goulash recipe is a spicy way to dress up stew beef. My mom made this when we were kids, and we loved it. It is spicy but not mouth-burning!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 pound beef stew meat, cut into cubes</li>
    <li>1 small yellow onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
    <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>¾ teaspoon distilled white vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dry mustard</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package egg noodles</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Prepare a large pot with cooking spray and place over medium heat; cook the beef stew meat in the pot until completely browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the onions; cook and stir until the onions begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir the water, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, paprika, salt, and mustard into the beef and onion mixture. Place a cover on the pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer the mixture until the beef is tender, about 2 1/2 hours.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the egg noodles at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain. Serve the goulash over the noodles.</li>
</ol>
