      <h3>Short Description:</h3>
      <p>
        This is a traditional walnut roll which is served in many Hungarian
        families at Christmas and Easter as a special treat. This recipe has
        been handed down in my family for generations. The preparation takes
        time, plus the dough needs an hour and 30 minutes of resting time, but
        the result is well worth the effort!

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <p><strong>For the Dough</strong></p>
        <li>5 tabelspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
        <li>4 cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <p><strong>For the Filling</strong></p>
        <li>1 cum whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 ½ cups finely chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
        <li>⅔ cup golden raisins</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Combine the 5 tablespoons sugar, butter, egg yolks, and sour cream in
          the bowl of a food processor fitted with the dough blade and process
          well. Add the flour and yeast and process until the dough comes
          together. If the dough feels too wet, add a little more flour; if it's
          too dry, add milk a tablespoon at a time. The dough should be moist
          and easy to work with.
        </li>
        <li>
          Shape the dough into a ball, cover with a damp towel, and set aside.
          To make the filling, heat the milk and 1 cup sugar in a saucepan until
          the sugar dissolves and the mixture has a syrupy consistency. Add the
          chopped walnuts and stir to combine. Remove the saucepan from the
          heat; stir in the lemon zest and raisins, and let filling cool.
        </li>
